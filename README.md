# Pioneers-pp: Bayesian statistics and ABC talk

The repo contains the examples and computer exercise that are associated with the *An Introduction to Bayesian Statistics and Approximate Bayesian Computing* Meetup event (https://www.meetup.com/Pioneers-of-Probabilistic-Programming/events/264336086/).

## File structure

- presentation.ipynb: notebook with the presentation.
- examples.ipynb: notebook with the code for the examples in the presentation.
- computer exercise.ipynb: the computer exercise (implementing ABC rejection sampling for the g-and-k distribution).
- computer exercise solutions.ipynb: solutions for computer exercise.
- cars.csv: the speed and stopping distance for 1920s cars dataset (see https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/datasets/html/cars.html).
- /fig: figures for the presentation and computer exercise.


## Software

We will use ```Julia 1.0.3``` (https://julialang.org/) for the examples and exercise.

The easiest way to run the code for the examples and the exercise is to use JuliaBox (https://www.juliabox.com/). To run the code that we use with JuliaBox then:

1. Go to https://www.juliabox.com/ and create a free account.
2. Clone (or download) this repo to your local computer.
3. In the JuliaBox start scree, click on the ```jupyter``` tab and upload following files to your ```jupyter``` environment: ```computer exercise.ipynd```, ```computer exercise solutions.ipynd```, ```examples.ipynd```, and ```cars.csv```.
4. You can now run the examples and work on the computer exercise.

To get started with ```Julia``` there are some tutorials provided in JuliaBox.

An alternative is to run everything on your local computer, which might be preferable if you already have installed ```Julia```.
